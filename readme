Instructions:
(tested on Mac OS 10.13.6, CentOS7, Scientific Linux 7.6)

1) Access the Code. Clone this repository on your local machine 
(Fork if planning to contribute). 

2) Set up the environment. Modify and execute the following lines 
  ( recommended to add them to your .bashrc file ) :

$ export WM_PARENT=/my/path/to/repository/parent/folder/
$ source ${WM_PARENT}/Wavedump_Wrapper/WM.sh

3) Build all the binaries
  ( requires root to be installed and its usual environment set ). 
$ cd $WM_CODE 
$ ./making.sh

4) Run file conversion and basic analysis to generate the analysis files and folders in the local directory. 

    [ NB the cooking stage requires that the data files are stored in a specific folder naming scheme with
    RUN000XXX containing a run number (e.g. XXX=001), PMT0YYY containing the PMT number (e.g YYY=005) with
    the leading 0 required, and TestName beginning with e.g. D (Dark Rate), N (Nominal), S (SPE) or G (Gain) ]

$ cd /my/path/to/parent/data/folder/RUN000001/PMT0130/Nominal/
$ source process_analyse_locally_auto.sh
